# Notice template action button changes

### Description

Introduce buttons to delete all queued notices for a given template.

### Components

-	[Notice Full Summary](../Components/NoticeFullSummary)
-	[Failed Table](../Components/FailedTable)
-	[Widget](../Components/Widget)

### Tasks

#### Notice Full Summary
- Create two new buttons on the Full Summary Component
	- Create “Delete (number#) queued notices” button and “Deactivate Template” button
	- Only visible if notices are queued. 
	- Buttons should not be exposed while notices are being regenerated. 
	- Clicking button will expose standard “Are you sure?” button. 
	- If no queued notices, don’t show “Delete queued notice” button.  This acts as both a confirmation that queued notices were deleted and keeps the UI clean. 
	- Decrease width of version module - giving more space back to “body” of template.

#### Widget
- Moved Promote, Show Change, Edit from the Widget to top of Full Summary Top Nav bar
- Add tooltip to Import button (on Widget) and disable it if incomplete template exists.
- Tooltip should say, “Please delete incomplete template first” (subject to change)
- Change “Show Change" button should be "Show Changes".

#### Failed Table
- Increased clarity on whether a failed notice when already retriggered. 
- On click of “retrigger notice” button, refresh list on left side.  Expectation is that: 
- Retriggered notice will automatically disappear. 
- Any updates (updated status, new records, etc) to list will automatically appear. 
- Additionally, every 3 seconds, auto-refresh list.
