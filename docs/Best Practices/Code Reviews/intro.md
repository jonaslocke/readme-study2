The communication guidelines for code reviews can be articulated as follows:

- Utilize PR comments as a platform for constructive discussion to derive optimal solutions, rather than employing them to impede the progress of your code.
- Any individual providing feedback on a proposed change is required to initiate the PR and set its status to "Request Changes," ensuring that the code remains unmerged until addressed, even if other reviewers have granted their approval.
- If the PR status indicates "Request Changes," refrain from merging your modifications until the necessary adjustments have been made.
- The owner of the PR should abstain from resolving comments; instead, the individual who issued the comment is responsible for its resolution.
- Each PR requires a minimum of two approvals before it can be merged.
- Only designated reviewers can resolve comments within the code review process.
