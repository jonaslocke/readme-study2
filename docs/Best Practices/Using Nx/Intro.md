NX is a powerful build and development tool for monorepo-style projects, commonly used with Angular applications. Here are 10 best practices for NX build tooling:

- Organize Your Codebase with Monorepo Structure:
  - Use a monorepo structure to organize your code, with separate libraries for shared functionality and applications for end-user products.
- Use Nx Generators for Consistent Project Setup:
  - Leverage Nx generators to create consistent project structures, whether it's for applications or libraries. This helps maintain a standard development environment.
- Maximize Code Reusability with Libraries:
  - Create libraries for shared code and components to maximize reusability across different parts of your application. This reduces redundancy and helps in maintaining a single source of truth.
- Fine-Tune Build and Test Configuration:
  - Customize the build and test configurations in the nx.json file to suit the specific needs of your project. This includes adjusting build options, test runners, and other settings.
- Utilize Nx Plugins for Cross-Cutting Concerns:
  - Take advantage of Nx plugins for common tasks such as linting, formatting, and testing. This ensures consistency across the entire codebase.
- Implement Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD):
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. This ensures that changes are consistently tested and deployed in a controlled manner.
- Optimize Build Performance:
  - Configure your build settings to optimize performance. This may include parallelizing tasks, caching dependencies, and leveraging incremental builds to reduce build times.
- Document and Version Control Your Nx Configuration:
  - Document the Nx configuration settings in your project and commit it to version control. This provides transparency and allows team members to understand and reproduce the project setup.
- Enforce Code Quality Standards:
  - Integrate tools like ESLint, Prettier, and TSLint to enforce code quality standards. This ensures that the codebase adheres to consistent style guidelines and is free of common issues.
- Regularly Update Dependencies:
  - Keep your Nx and other dependencies up to date. Regularly check for updates and follow a systematic process to update dependencies to benefit from bug fixes, new features, and performance improvements.

These best practices can help you maintain a scalable, maintainable, and efficient codebase using Nx build tooling.

In the Nx environment, you typically use the Nx CLI to run various commands for managing and developing your monorepo. Here are six common Nx commands along with examples:

- Create a New Application:
  - Use the nx generate command to create a new application.

```bash
nx generate @nrwl/angular:app my-app
```

- Create a New Library:
  - Use the nx generate command to create a new library.

```bash
nx generate @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib
```

- Run Tests for All Projects:
  - Use the nx test command to run tests for all projects in the workspace.

```bash
nx test
```

- Build All Projects:
  - Use the nx build command to build all projects in the workspace.

```bash
nx build
```

- Lint All Projects:
  - Use the nx lint command to lint all projects in the workspace.

```bash
nx lint
```

- Serve an Application:
  - Use the nx serve command to start a development server for an application.

```bash
nx serve my-app
```

These examples showcase some of the fundamental Nx commands for generating projects, running tests, building, linting, and serving applications. The actual commands might vary based on the specific plugins and project types you have in your Nx workspace. Always refer to the official Nx documentation or use nx --help for detailed information about available commands and options.
